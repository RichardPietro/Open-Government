Why Open Data Matters
=====================

This page is as much for me answering that question for myself as it is for collecting resources. Additions welcome.

##Definition

“Open data is data that can be freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone – subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.” - See more at: http://okfn.org/opendata/#sthash.LPAs5hsk.dpuf

##Background

Open data is a curious thing. I'm a strong supporter, and the benefits appear to be many. But when I started trying to make the case I was struggling to find evidence for those requiring cold, hard numbers. I think this is partially because the idea is still new to many, and partially because it is by definition difficult to track the value and uses of data made open.

The [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/opendata/) lists three common reasons for why data should be open:

1. Transparency
2. Releasing Social and Commercial Value
3. Participation and Engagement

Social and commercial value is straightforward enough. Govlab recently did a census of 500 US businesses largely powered by government data. McKinsey estimates the possibility for $3B in additional value through open data. And Deloitte pegged the value of the [economy for social solutions](http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_CA/ca/insights/insights-and-issues/solutioneconomy/index.htm) at $50B in Canada, alone. To bring that down to a tangible example, the easy one is bus tracker apps: using open GPS data for public transit to give people a more reliable system with which to organize their commutes.

Less waste, more productivity, less stress, better lives.

But #1 and #3 are trickier reasons. The [relationship between transparency and participation](http://democracyspot.net/2013/06/19/does-transparency-lead-to-trust-some-evidence-on-the-subject/) is complex, and needs more time and investigation. It seems that much of the push for open is based on ideology and principles, which is fine. But there are other stakeholders to convince.

So if our goal is better societal outcomes, we have work to do in understanding both the economic and social benefits of open data, and developing a long-term lense on the idea.

I've started a list of resources, here, to which I'd love additions.
