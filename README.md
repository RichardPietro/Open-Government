Open-Government
===============

Earlier today I was asked the following:

"How do millenials get involved in Open Government? Any good reads for the movement?" And my answer was longer than tweet length, and will certainly benefit from improvement from others, so now it's on Github.


Firstly, Open Government is - and has to be - for everyone. If we're talking about making government more accessible to citizens, easier to navigate, and more understandable? That's definitely for everyone. But even if we're talking about voluntary interaction with government, say, citizen engagement in decisionmaking? It's government's responsibility to ensure that people have the resources they need to decide whether or not they want to invest time and energy in those opportunities. And that there are no (or at least minimal) social, economic, technological, and cultural barriers to that participation.


How to get involved:

Involvement in anything is easier and more fun if your friends or peers are on board. If your school or organization has politically, civically, or socially active societies, check to see if they're keeping tabs on ways to tap into municipal, provincial, or federal government activities.

The Province of Ontario has been hosting roundtables about how they're going to approach Open Government. They just swung through Ottawa, but keep tabs here: [http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-government-expert-team]

The federal government is likewise going to be hosting roundtables on their Open Government Action Plan. Those will be updated here: [http://data.gc.ca/eng/consultations]

And Ottawa's doing a great job. Their public consultations: [http://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/public-consultations/public-engagement/public-engagement-strategy-and-consultations]

That said, the far easier way to keep tabs on upcoming events is to request to be added to a mailing list for a jurisdiction, or follow #OpenGov or #OpenON hashtags on Twitter, or key figures: open government enthusiasts, public officials, key government departments, or awesome organizations like Samara Canada or MaRS in Canada, or the Govlab in the U.S.

If you're interested in getting into the weeds in Open Government? As in, as a driver, not as a citizen participant? Look for local Open Government or Open Data events. There are a lot of generalists and passionate civil society representatives that attend Open Data events because the interests overlap. Or, for any of the links above? Email the contact and tell them that you want to get involved, or get added to a distribution list.

Google is your friend, here. But if you want names and contacts, I'm  happy to help, just email me.

Side note: Open Government people are friendly. You can just show up alone to events, and they'll be cool. I promise.

Here's everything that'll happen on Open Data Day (February 22): [http://wiki.opendataday.org/2014/City_Events]

There is likely going to be an Ottawa "Open Data Open Mic" event added.

And as always, the avenues we have but sometimes forget about: write, call, or email your municipal, provincial, or federal representatives. "Open Government" is a movement with a fuzzy definition; the important thing is that you achieve your goal for what you want to get across to your government.


What to read?

If you're new to the idea of Open Government, start with this: [http://cairns.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/whats-in-a-name-open-gov-we-gov-gov-20-collaborative-government.html]

And if you're not sated, the standard long reads would be Open Government, a book written by many awesome people, released for free in full to honour Aaron Schwartz:

Or, perhaps, Beyond Transparency (also written by many awesome people, also released for free in full):

[http://beyondtransparency.org/]

And for these and shorter pieces, The Govlab has done an awesome job curating an Open Government reading list as part of their Gov 3.0 course:

Done for now! Let me know if you'd like me to add or clarify anything. Or, just add it yourself! - Kent
